Dear Toastmaster fellow and guest, Ladies and Gentlemen. Does you ever heard about Toastmaster Conference. “Yes” - Congratulations. You are the veteran of Toastmaster. “No” - Never heard about it? Don’t worry. I will tell you now. You will be veteran of Toastmaster soon.

Toastmaster conference duration is 3 days, and each year one times in holding city. This city is voted by all clubs in two years before. It included Contest, Gala party and workshop. If you are interested on detail schedule, you can read the manual of this program handbook offline. \(Bring Hand book out send to audience\) I was brainwash by lot of senior Toastmaster fellows. They told me that it is a interesting activity. it is worth to come for newbie. “Curiosity kill Cat.” I am just that cat. I purchased a second hand ticket – First hand already sold out - jumped to Harbin conference by plane. In that time, I joint Toastmaster less than one month.

Now let’s introduce my adventure experience in Harbin conference. Its slogan is “Booming”. I will introduce it from three aspects.

First – People. The most impressed point in this conference is people – passionate people. Most of people in conference are open, kindness. They all saw conference as a good social platform. So in conference you can quickly get familiar with each other. I added 59 WeChat contacts in this conference. \(show picture of WeChat label\)

If you are single. That will be a good for you. A picture for our handsome gentleman and beautiful ladies in Division C at Harbin conference. \(Show Division C group picture\)

Still people in conference were friendly sharing their feeling and experience with each other. People who joint conference came from different cities and different jobs – Taiyuan, Xian, Shenyang, Dalian, Qingdao ….; Trainer, coach, Insurance agent, presale …Consider our friends are mainly engineers, this will increase variety of social network.

Second aspect is activity – I am focus to introduce Speech contest and election contest Speech contest is bright spot of conference. All players who stood on stage are winners in each district. I see the beauty of speech. In their speech lots of vivid, heart-warming stories came out. Lots of ladies are moved by speech with tear drop. I’d like two speeches one is in Chinese speech related with her grandpa and grandma’s love story. Another one is English speech “Artist”. The player went onto the stage while playing violin \(He has ever learned violin nearly 10 years\). His speech described his grew up story switch from violin to football. And extended to all people who love the things and do it with heart are Artist.

Election contest is still an interesting activity. People who ran for district executive committee or division director went on to stage, show their personality and capability. It organized like campus group. The contest both splendid and intense. It is a good chance to observe how this type of organization work. It is interesting for us who is working in hierarchy organization

Third aspect is self-grow up and self-demonstration To join conference, only see other people is not enough. you must really “join” it, to contribute on it, to take role in it. If you are not strong to join speech contest and election contest. Workshop and Gala Party are your choice. I joint round table activity in this conference as visual recorder. This is my work. \(Show pictures\)

To take this role I joint training before conference. And did excise in free time. Now I am half master on this skill. Still I knew some interesting friends in this duration.

Toastmaster is a NGO organization, there is no money driven on it. So people in it just drove by their willing. This maybe the reason for its charming.

Dear Toastmaster fellow and guest, I went to Toastmaster Harbin Conference with curiosity to search for people with energy, to recharge myself. I found. From City demonstration, I see solidarity; from whole conference process, I see cooperation; from Gala party, I felt self-release, and felt refresh. The Bible says, "Seek, and ye shall find". I went to conference to search interesting people and brilliant spirit. I found them. Toastmaster conference is worth to go
