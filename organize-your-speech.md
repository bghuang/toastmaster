# Seek, and ye shall find
Dear Toastmaster fellow and guest, Ladies and Gentlemen. Does you ever hear Toastmaster Conference. 

Dear Toastmaster fellow and guest,  I went to Toastmaster Harbin Conference with curiosity to search for people with energy. I found. From City demostration,  I see solidarity; from whole conference process, I see cooperation; from Gala party, I see self release. The Bible says, "Seek, and ye shall find". So I went to conference to search interesting people and brilliant spirit. I found it. Toastmast conference is worth for newbie to go.
