# The Ice Breaker

## Curiosity - The power drive me

Dear Toastmaster members, Ladies and Gentlemen. I am glad to share with you about my hobbies.

When I was a little kid. I just feel curiosity to the world around me. Why the Sun is shining, why the little toy can move by spring; how the flower was put into glass ball. there are a lot of amazing things I didn't know. They were really attractive me. To be a naturalist, to know everything unknown is my dream in that time.

To know all these, I read lots of books, reading became my hobby. Till now reading is still my favorite activity. The content already extends for nature to humanity. From how toy assembled to how the society run. I still remember the age, I was hungry to read all books to get new knowledge. Let me share an interesting memory piece with all of you - When I am young. there are few books in home. Only one of my neighbor uncle Liu  who had a set of&lt;&lt; 100,000 why?&gt;&gt; in his home. That is a miraculous book which include answer to different type of questions.  It was one of my favorite book when I was young. In that book, each answer start with one sentence of Quotations from Chairman Mao.Till now I still remember a picture - a young child hold a book reading in sun - " The word is ours and yours. but in the final analysis, it is yours. You are the morning sun at eight or nine. "

Beside reading,my curiosity still effects on speaking. I'd like to talk with different people about novel things. Especially the thing I don't know before. I like the people who can bring to me new vision and fresh information. When I was traveling indifferent countries and different regions. I always chat with locals to get their view and idea to the world. I talked with Egyptian Orthodox Eastern about their fasting tradition. Oh. fasting of Orthodox is no less than Muslim, they will fast frequently in each month and those all can be tracked back to story in Holy Bible. For example: one story about Jesus and fish, then that day is fasting for fish. Still I talk with a New Zealand nationality India guy about his elder female cousin who is a Jain. She can keep an awful fasting for half month without any food only water. The world is full of magic, I am a curiosity boy who are interested to discover them.

Explore museum and art gallery is still my hobby. It is a way to satisfy my curiosity as well. When I was travelling in different countries, I took almost all free weekend to go to visit local museum, art gallery or historical spot. From there I know their history,  their culture. Till now I still remember Museum in Chicago. They move a small pyramid from Egypt brick by brick. Still they put a submarine inside Museum basement. Its name is  U505 -  prototype of movie "U571". These exhibitions on display really gave me more knowledge on this interesting word.

Dear toastmasters, Curiosity is the power which drive me to join toastmaster as well. I cam here because I was feel curiosity on this organization. So I join it. I am glad to meet lots of people who keep positive and energy here. I am happy for that.
