# The Ice Breaker

## Curiosity - The power drive me

Dear fellow Toastmasters, Ladies and Gentlemen. This is Baogui Huang.

When I was a little kid, I was curious about  the world around me. “Why is the Sun shining？ why can the little toy move by spring? how is the flower  put into the glass ball?” there were  a lot of questions confused me. They were really attractive to me. To know everything unknown was my dream at that time.

I started to read every book I could get to look for answers to the questions. I read and read, so reading became my hobby. And of cause, some confusions were resolved by reading. Till now reading is still my favorite activity. The content already extends from nature to humanity. From how the toy is assembled to how the society runs. I still remember the age that I was hungry to  search all books to get new knowledge. When I was young，there were few books in my home.  one of my neighbor -- uncle Liu who had a set of&lt;&lt; 100,000 why?&gt;&gt; . That was a miraculous book with  answers to different kinds of questions. It was one of my favorite books when I was young. In that book, each answer started with one Quotation from Chairman Mao. Till now I still remember a picture - a young child held a book reading in sun - " The world is ours and yours. but in the final analysis, it is yours. You are the morning sun at eight or nine. "

Besides reading, my curiosity still effects on speaking. I'd like to talk with different people about different things. Especially the thing I don't know before. I like people who can bring me new vision and fresh information. When I was traveling indifferent countries and different regions， I always chatted with locals to get their view and idea to the world. I learned the fasting tradition in the talking with the Egyptian Orthodox Eastern. Oh. fasting of Orthodox is no less than Muslim, they fast f monthly and those all can be tracked back to the story in Holy Bible. For example: one story about Jesus and fish, then that day is fasting for fish. Once I talked with a New Zealand nationality India guy about his elder female cousin who was a Jain. She can keep an awful fasting for half month without any food only water. The world is full of magic, and I am a curious boy who is interested to discover them.

Because of the curiosity, I visit almost every museum and art gallery I met. It is a way to satisfy my curiosity as well. When I was travelling in different countries, I took almost all free weekends to go to visit local museums, art galleries and historical spots. From there I know their history and their culture. The most impressive museum was the one in Chicago. It moved a small pyramid from Egypt brick by brick, and Still they put a submarine inside the Museum basement. Its name is U505 - prototype of movie "U571". These exhibitions really gave me more information of this interesting world.

I grew up with curiosity. I want to know more about the world, and also about Toastmasters, that’s why I join SSTMC. I came here because I feel curious about this organization and now I am closer and closer to it. I am glad  being here with you, keeping positive and energetic here. 

My Friends, World is wide. To know it and to understand it, you must be full of curiosity. to search to discover the wonderful of life. with curiosity I never feel boring, and I always keep positive. You will always see a new wonderful world every day. Let me finish my speech with Steven Jobs' words - "Stay hungry, Stay foolish" - Let's keep our curiosity to grow up together.
