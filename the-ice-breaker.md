# The Ice Breaker

## Curiosity - The power drive me

“Dad, Why Sun is shining?”

“It is a fire ball, keep burning.”

“Why is it not burned up?”

“It’s huge and can burn many years.”

“But it looks small, only like a pie”

“That is because it is far away from us”

“How do you know it is far away?”

“Oh…”

As a parents do you ever been asked for those type of endless questions beyond your imagination? Do you ever ask those endless questions when you were a kid?

Yes, I was. I was the curious boy in that time. Lots of strange questions sparkled out from my little mind. How could I know the answer of those questions? Reading is a good idea.

So I started to read all books I could get. I read and read, reading became my hobby. I was so steeped into readying, so that I often forgot lunch and dinner. In that time, there were few books in home. Fortunately, one of my neighbor -- uncle Liu, he had a set of &lt;&lt; 100,000 why?&gt;&gt; . That was a miraculous book. It answered lots of questions. So I often spend whole day to stay in his home. I still remember that each answer started with one Quotation from Chairman Mao in that book. You can image a picture - a young child held a book reading in sun

“Why Sun is shining?”

" The world is ours and yours. but in the final analysis, it is yours. You are the morning sun at eight or nine. "

“Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing”. Besides reading, my curiosity still took effects on oral communication, so my second hobby came. I'd like to satisfied my curiosity by talk with different people about different things. When I was traveling indifferent countries and different regions, I always kept curious about different culture and their traditional customs. I’d like to chat with locals to get their view and idea to the world. With curiosity, I always can find new info in life. When I was traveling in Qatar. I normally had lunch with one Egypt colleague – Samir.

“Samir, Let’s go for lunch.”

“Oh. Today I am fasting”

Next day.

“Samir, Let’s go for lunch.”

“Oh. Today I am fasting”

“Oh his is fasting again”

The third day.

“Samir, today you can have lunch, right?”

“Yes”

“Good, Mourad gave me a good restaurant address. It is famous for fish. Let’s go there.”

“Oh No. I cannot eat fish today.”

“Why?” My curiosity drove me to ask detail about this. Then I knew that his belief is Orthodox. They do fasting follow Holy Bible. That day there is a story between Jesus and fish. So he could not eat fish at that time. Actually Eastern Christian do fasting frequently. Summary fasting days is no less than Muslim. Out of China, religion impact on people’s life strongly beyond your imagination.

My third hobby is visit museum, art gallery and history spot. It still come from curiosity. When I was travelling in different countries, I spent almost all free weekends on it. From there I know their history and their culture. Exhibitions really gave me more information of this interesting world.

~~I grew up with curiosity. I want to know more about the world, and also about Toastmasters, that’s why I join SSTMC. I came here because I feel curious about this organization and now I am closer and closer to it. I am glad being here with you, keeping positive and energetic here.~~

My Friends, World is wide. To know it and to understand it, you must be full of curiosity to search to discover the wonderful of life. with curiosity you will never feel boring, and you will always keep positive. Every morning, when you open your eyes, you will always see a new wonderful world.
